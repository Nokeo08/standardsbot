            "1": "\n>**Rejection 1**\n\n>*That the will of God to save those who would believe and would persevere in faith and in the obedience of faith, is the whole and entire decree of election unto salvation, and that nothing else concerning this decree has been revealed in God's Word.*\n\n>For these deceive the simple and plainly contradict the Scriptures which declare that God will not only save those who will believe, but that He has also from eternity chosen certain particular persons to whom above others He in time will grant both faith in Christ and perseverance, as it is written: \"I have manifested Thy Name unto the men which Thou gavest Me out of the world\" (John 17:6). \"And as many as were ordained to eternal life believed\" (Acts 13:48). And: \"According as He hath chosen us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before Him in love\" (Eph. 1:4).*\n",
            "2": "\n>**Rejection 2**\n\n>*That there are various kinds of election of God unto eternal life: the one general and indefinite, the other particular and definite; and that the latter in turn is either incomplete, revocable, nondecisive and conditional, or complete, irrevocable, decisive and absolute. Likewise: that there is one election unto faith and another unto salvation, so that election can be unto justifying faith without being a decisive election unto salvation.*\n\n>For this is a fancy of men\u2019s minds, invented regardless of the Scriptures, whereby the doctrine of election is corrupted, and this golden chain of our salvation is broken: \"Moreover whom He did predestinate, them He also called: and whom He called, them He also justified: and whom He justified, them He also glorified\" (Rom. 8:30).*\n",
            "3": "\n>**Rejection 3**\n\n>*That the good pleasure and purpose of God, of which Scripture makes mention in the doctrine of election, does not consist in this, that God chose certain persons rather than others, but in this, that He chose out of all possible conditions (among which are also the works of the law), or out of the whole order of things, the act of faith which from its very nature is undeserving, as well as its incomplete obedience, as a condition of salvation, and that He would graciously consider this in itself as a complete obedience and count it worthy of the reward of eternal life*\n\n>For by this injurious error the pleasure of God and the merits of Christ are made of none effect, and men are drawn away by useless questions from the truth of gracious justification and from the simplicity of Scripture, and this declaration of the apostle is charged as untrue: \"Who hath saved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to His own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began\" (2 Tim. 1:9).*\n",
            "4": "\n>**Rejection 4**\n\n>*That in the election unto faith this condition is beforehand demanded, namely, that man should use the light of nature aright, be pious, humble, meek, and fit for eternal life, as if on these things election were in any way dependent*\n\n>For this savors of the teaching of Pelagius, and is opposed to the doctrine of the apostle, when he writes: \"Among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind; and were by nature the children of wrath, even as others. But God, who is rich in mercy, for His great love wherewith He loved us, even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ, (by grace ye are saved;) and hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus: that in the ages to come He might show the exceeding riches of His grace in His kindness toward us through Christ Jesus. For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: not of works, lest any man should boast\" (Eph. 2:3\u20139).*\n",
            "5": "\n>**Rejection 5**\n\n>*That the incomplete and non-decisive election of particular persons to salvation occurred because of a foreseen faith, conversion, holiness, godliness, which either began or continued for some time; but that the complete and decisive election occurred because of foreseen perseverance unto the end in faith, conversion, holiness and godliness; and that this is the gracious and evangelical worthiness for the sake of which he who is chosen is more worthy than he who is not chosen; and that therefore faith, the obedience of faith, holiness, godliness and perseverance are not fruits of the unchangeable election unto glory, but are conditions, which, being required beforehand, were foreseen as being met by those who will be fully elected, and are causes without which the unchangeable election to glory does not occur.*\n\n>This is repugnant to the entire Scripture which constantly inculcates this and similar declarations: Election is not out of works, but of Him that calleth. \"That the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works, but of Him that calleth\" (Rom. 9:11). \"And as many as were ordained to eternal life believed\" (Acts 13:48). \"He hath chosen us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy\" (Eph. 1:4). \"Ye have not chosen Me, but I have chosen you\" (John 15:16). \"But if it be of works, then is it no more grace\" (Rom. 11:6). \"Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that He loved us, and sent His Son\" (1 John 4:10).*\n",
            "6": "\n>**Rejection 6**\n\n>*That not every election unto salvation is unchangeable, but that some of the elect, any decree of God notwithstanding, can yet perish and do indeed perish.*\n\n>By which gross error they make God to be changeable, and destroy the comfort which the godly obtain out of the firmness of their election, and contradict the Holy Scripture which teaches that the elect cannot be led astray: \"Insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect\" (Matt. 24:24); that Christ does not lose those whom the Father gave Him: \"And this is the Father's will which hath sent Me, that of all which He hath given Me I should lose nothing\" (John 6:39); and that God hath also glorified those whom He foreordained, called and justified: \"Moreover whom He did predestinate, them He also called: and whom He called, them He also justified: and whom He justified, them He also glorified\" (Rom. 8:30).*\n",
            "7": "\n>**Rejection 7**\n\n>*That there is in this life no fruit and no consciousness of the unchangeable election to glory, nor any certainty, except that which depends on a changeable and uncertain condition.*\n\n>For not only is it absurd to speak of an uncertain certainty, but also contrary to the experience of the saints, who by virtue of the consciousness of their election rejoice with the apostle and praise this favor of God, Ephesians 1; who according to Christ's admonition rejoice with His disciples that their names are written in heaven, \"but rather rejoice, because your names are written in heaven\" (Luke 10:20); who also place the consciousness of their election over against the fiery darts of the devil, asking: \"Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect?\" (Rom. 8:33).*\n",
            "8": "\n>**Rejection 8**\n\n>*That God, simply by virtue of His righteous will, did not decide either to leave anyone in the fall of Adam and in the common state of sin and condemnation, or to pass anyone by in the communication of grace which is necessary for faith and conversion.*\n\n>For this is firmly decreed: \"Therefore hath He mercy on whom He will have mercy, and whom He will He hardeneth\" (Rom. 9:18). And also this: \"It is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given\" (Matt. 13:11). Likewise: \"I thank Thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because Thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes. Even so, Father: for so it seemed good in Thy sight\" (Matt. 11:25\u201326).*\n",
            "9": "\n>**Rejection 9**\n\n>*That the reason why God sends the gospel to one people rather than to another is not merely and solely the good pleasure of God, but rather the fact that one people is better and worthier than another to whom the gospel is not communicated.*\n\n>For this Moses denies, addressing the people of Israel as follows: \"Behold, the heaven and the heaven of heavens is the LORD'S thy God, the earth also, with all that therein is. Only the LORD had a delight in thy fathers to love them, and He chose their seed after them, even you above all people, as it is this day\" (Deut. 10:14\u201315). And Christ said: \"Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works, which were done in you, had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes\" (Matt. 11:21).*\n"

            "1": "\n>**Rejection 1**\n\n>*That God the Father has ordained His Son to the death of the cross without a certain and definite decree to save any, so that the necessity, profitableness and worth of what Christ merited by His death might have existed, and might remain in all its parts complete, perfect and intact, even if the merited redemption had never in fact been applied to any person.*\n\n>For this doctrine tends to the despising of the wisdom of the Father and of the merits of Jesus Christ, and is contrary to Scripture. For thus saith our Savior: \"I lay down My life for the sheep, and I know them\" (John 10:15, 27). And the prophet Isaiah saith concerning the Savior: \"When thou shalt make His soul an offering for sin, He shall see His seed, He shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of the LORD shall prosper in his hand\" (Is. 53:10). Finally, this contradicts the article of faith according to which we believe the catholic Christian church.*\n",
            "2": "\n>**Rejection 2**\n\n>*That it was not the purpose of the death of Christ that He should confirm the new covenant of grace through His blood, but only that He should acquire for the Father the mere right to establish with man such a covenant as He might please, whether of grace or of works.*\n\n>For this is repugnant to Scripture which teaches that Christ has become the Surety and Mediator of a better, that is, the new covenant, and that a testament is of force where death has occurred. \"By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament\" (Heb. 7:22); \"And for this cause He is the Mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance\"; \"For a testament is of force after men are dead: otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth\" (Heb. 9:15, 17).*\n",
            "3": "\n>**Rejection 3**\n\n>*That Christ by His satisfaction merited neither salvation itself for anyone, nor faith, whereby this satisfaction of Christ unto salvation is effectually appropriated; but that He merited for the Father only the authority or the perfect will to deal again with man, and to prescribe new conditions as He might desire, obedience to which, however, depended on the free will of man, so that it therefore might have come to pass that either none or all should fulfill these conditions.*\n\n>For these adjudge too contemptuously of the death of Christ, do in no wise acknowledge the most important fruit or benefit thereby gained, and bring again out of hell the Pelagian error.*\n",
            "4": "\n>**Rejection 4**\n\n>*That the new covenant of grace, which God the Father, through the mediation of the death of Christ, made with man, does not herein consist that we by faith, inasmuch as it accepts the merits of Christ, are justified before God and saved, but in the fact that God having revoked the demand of perfect obedience of faith, regards faith itself and the obedience of faith, although imperfect, as the perfect obedience of the law, and does esteem it worthy of the reward of eternal life through grace.*\n\n>For these contradict the Scriptures: \"Being justified freely by His grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus: whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in His blood\" (Rom. 3:24\u201325). And these proclaim, as did the wicked Socinus, a new and strange justification of man before God against the consensus of the whole church.*\n",
            "5": "\n>**Rejection 5**\n\n>*That all men have been accepted unto the state of reconciliation and unto the grace of the covenant, so that no one is worthy of condemnation on account of original sin, and that no one shall be condemned because of it, but that all are free from the guilt of original sin*\n\n>For this opinion is repugnant to Scripture which teaches that we are by nature children of wrath (Eph. 2:3).*\n",
            "6": "\n>**Rejection 6**\n\n>*The use of the difference between meriting and appropriating, to the end that they may instill into the minds of the imprudent and inexperienced this teaching that God, as far as He is concerned, has been minded of applying to all equally the benefits gained by the death of Christ; but that, while some obtain the pardon of sin and eternal life, and others do not, this difference depends on their own free will, which joins itself to the grace that is offered without exception, and that it is not dependent on the special gift of mercy, which powerfully works in them, that they rather than others should appropriate unto themselves this grace.*\n\n>For these, while they feign that they present this distinction in a sound sense, seek to instill into the people the destructive poison of the Pelagian errors.*\n",
            "7": "\n>**Rejection 7**\n\n>*That Christ neither could die, needed to die, nor did die for those whom God loved in the highest degree and elected to eternal life, and did not die for these, since these do not need the death of Christ.*\n\n>For they contradict the apostle, who declares: \"the Son of God, who loved me, and gave Himself for me\" (Gal. 2:20). Likewise: \"Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? It is God that justifieth. Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died\" (Rom. 8:33\u201334), namely, for them; and the Savior who says: \"I lay down My life for the sheep\" (John 10:15). And: \"This is My commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved you. Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends\" (John 15:12\u201313).*\n"

            "3": "\n>**Rejection 3**\n\n>*That in spiritual death the spiritual gifts are not separate from the will of man, since the will in itself has never been corrupted, but only hindered through the darkness of the understanding and the irregularity of the affections; and that, these hindrances having been removed, the will can then bring into operation its native powers, that is, that the will of itself is able to will and to choose, or not to will and not to choose, all manner of good which may be presented to it.*\n\n>This is an innovation and an error, and tends to elevate the powers of the free will, contrary to the declaration of the prophet: \"The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked\" (Jer. 17:9); and of the apostle: \"Among whom (sons of disobedience) also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind\" (Eph. 2:3).*\n",

            "5": "\n>**Rejection 5**\n\n>*That the corrupt and natural man can so well use the common grace (by which they understand the light of nature), or the gifts still left him after the fall, that he can gradually gain by their good use a greater, namely, the evangelical or saving grace and salvation itself. And that in this way God on His part shows Himself ready to reveal Christ unto all men, since He applies to all sufficiently and efficiently the means necessary to conversion.*\n\n>For the experience of all ages and the Scriptures do both testify that this is untrue. \"He sheweth His word unto Jacob, His statutes and His judgments unto Israel. He hath not dealt so with any nation: and as for His judgments, they have not known them\" (Ps. 147:19, 20). \"Who in times past suffered all nations to walk in their own ways\" (Acts 14:16). And: \"Now when they (Paul and his companions) had gone throughout Phrygia and the region of Page 13 Galatia, and were forbidden of the Holy Ghost to preach the word in Asia, after they were come to Mysia, they assayed to go into Bithynia: but the Spirit suffered them not\" (Acts 16:6, 7).*\n",
            "6": "\n>**Rejection 6**\n\n>*That in the true conversion of man no new qualities, powers or gifts can be infused by God into the will, and that therefore faith through which we are first converted, and because of which we are called believers, is not a quality or gift infused by God, but only an act of man, and that it cannot be said to be a gift, except in respect of the power to attain to this faith.*\n\n>For thereby they contradict the Holy Scriptures which declare that God infuses new qualities of faith, of obedience, and of the consciousness of His love into our hearts: \"I will put My law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts\" (Jer. 31:33). And: \"I will pour water upon him that is thirsty, and floods upon the dry ground: I will pour My Spirit upon thy seed\" (Is. 44:3). And: \"the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us\" (Rom. 5:5).

And: \"That our God would...fulfil all the good pleasure of His goodness, and the work of faith with power\" (2 Thess. 1:11).

            "8": "\n>**Rejection 8**\n\n>*That God in the regeneration of man does not use such powers of His omnipotence as potently and infallibly bend man's will to faith and conversion; but that all the works of grace having been accomplished, which God employs to convert man, man may yet so resist God and the Holy Spirit when God intends man's regeneration and wills to regenerate him, and indeed that man often does so resist that he prevents entirely his regeneration, and that it therefore remains in man's power to be regenerated or not*\n\n>For this is nothing less than the denial of all the efficiency of God's grace in our conversion, and the subjecting of the working of the Almighty God to the will of man, which is contrary to the apostles, who teach: \"who believe, according to the working of His mighty power\" (Eph. 1:19). And: \"That our God would...fulfil all the good pleasure of His goodness, and the work of faith with power\" (2 Thess. 1:11). And: \"According as His divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness\" (2 Pet. 1:3).*\n",
            "9": "\n>**Rejection 9**\n\n>*That grace and free will are partial causes, which together work the beginning of conversion, and that grace, in order of working, does not precede the working of the will; that is, that God does not efficiently help the will of man unto conversion until the will of man moves and determines to do this.*\n\n>For the ancient Church has long ago condemned this doctrine of the Pelagians according to the words of the apostle: \"So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy\" (Rom. 9:16). Likewise: \"For who maketh thee to differ from another? and what hast thou that thou didst not receive?\" (1 Cor. 4:7). And: \"For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of His good pleasure\" (Phil. 2:13).*\n"

            "0": "\n\n>**FIFTH HEAD OF DOCTRINE**\n\n>**Of the Perseverance of the Saints**\n",
            "1": "\n>**Rejection 1**\n\n>*Who teach: That the perseverance of the true believers is not a fruit of election, or a gift of God, gained by the death of Christ, but a condition of the new covenant, which (as they declare) man before his decisive election and justification must fulfill through his free will. For the Holy Scripture testifies that this follows out of election, and is given the elect in virtue of the death, the resurrection and intercession of Christ: \"But the elect obtained it and the rest were hardened,\" Romans 11:7. Likewise: \"He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not also with him freely give us all things? Who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect? It is God that justifieth; who is he that condemneth? It is Christ Jesus that died, yea rather, that was raised from the dead, who is at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us. Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?\" Romans 8:32-35.*\n",
            "2": "\n>**Rejection 2**\n\n>*Who teach: That God does indeed provide the believer with sufficient powers to persevere, and is ever ready to preserve these in him, if he will do his duty; but that though all things, which are necessary to persevere in faith and which God will use to preserve faith, are made use of, it even then ever depends on the pleasure of the will whether it will persevere or not. For this idea contains an outspoken Pelagianism, and while it would make men free, it makes them robbers of God's honor, contrary to the prevailing agreement of the evangelical doctrine, which takes from man all cause of boasting, and ascribes all the praise for this favor to the grace of God alone; and contrary to the Apostle, who declares: \"That it is God, who shall also confirm you unto the end, that ye be unreprovable in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ,\" I Corinthians 1:8.*\n",
            "3": "\n>**Rejection 3**\n\n>*Who teach: That the true believers and regenerate not only can fall from justifying faith and likewise from grace and salvation wholly and to the end, but indeed often do fall from this and are lost forever. For this conception makes powerless the grace, justification, regeneration, and continued keeping by Christ, contrary to the expressed words of the Apostle Paul: \"That while we were yet sinners Christ died for us. Much more then, being justified by his blood, shall we be saved from the wrath of God through him,\" Romans 5:8,9. And contrary to the Apostle John: \"Whosoever is begotten of God doeth no sin, because his seed abideth in him; and he can not sin, because he is begotten of God,\" I John 3:9. And also contrary to the words of Jesus Christ: \"I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, and no one shall snatch them out of my hand. My Father who hath given them to me, is greater than all; and no one is able to snatch them out of the Father's hand,\" John 10:28,29.*\n",
            "4": "\n>**Rejection 4**\n\n>*Who teach: That true believers and regenerate can sin the sin unto death or against the Holy Spirit. Since the same Apostle John, after having spoken in the fifth chapter of his first epistle, vss. 16 and 17, of those who sin unto death and having forbidden to pray for them, immediately adds to this in vs. 18: \"We know that whosoever is begotten of God sinneth not (meaning a sin of that character), but he that is begotten of God keepeth himself, and the evil one toucheth him not,\" I John 5:18.*\n",
            "5": "\n>**Rejection 5**\n\n>*Who teach: That without a special revelation we can have no certainty of future perseverance in this life. For by this doctrine the sure comfort of all believers is taken away in this life, and the doubts of the papist are again introduced into the church, while the Holy Scriptures constantly deduce this assurance, not from a special and extraordinary revelation, but from the marks proper to the children of God and from the constant promises of God. So especially the Apostle Paul: \"No creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord,\" Romans 8:39. And John declares: \"And he that keepeth his commandments abideth in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he gave us,\" I John 3:24.*\n",
            "6": "\n>**Rejection 6**\n\n>*Who teach: That the doctrine of the certainty of perseverance and of salvation from its own character and nature is a cause of indolence and is injurious to godliness, good morals, prayers and other holy exercises, but that on the contrary it is praiseworthy to doubt. For these show that they do not know the power of divine grace and the working of the indwelling Holy Spirit. And they contradict the Apostle John, who teaches the opposite with express words in his first epistle: \"Beloved, now are we the children of God, and it is not yet made manifest what we shall be. We know that, if he shall be manifested, we shall be like him, for we shall see him even as he is. And every one that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure,\" I John 3:2, 3. Furthermore, these are contradicted by the example of the saints, both of the Old and New Testament, who though they were assured of their perseverance and salvation, were nevertheless constant in prayers and other exercises of godliness.*\n",
            "7": "\n>**Rejection 7**\n\n>*Who teach: That the faith of those, who believe for a time, does not differ from justifying and saving faith except only in duration. For Christ himself, in Matthew 13:20, Luke 8:13, and in other places, evidently notes, besides this duration, a threefold difference between those who believe only for a time and true believers, when he declares that the former receive the seed in stony ground, but the latter in the good ground or heart; that the former are without root, but that the latter have a firm root; that the former are without fruit, but that the latter bring forth their fruit in various measure, with constancy and steadfastness.*\n",
            "8": "\n>**Rejection 8**\n\n>*Who teach: That it is not absurd that one having lost his first regeneration, is again and even often born anew. For these deny by this doctrine the incorruptibleness of the seed of God, whereby we are born again. Contrary to the testimony of the Apostle Peter: \"Having been begotten again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible,\" I Peter 1:23.*\n",
            "9": "\n>**Rejection 9**\n\n>*Who teach: That Christ has in no place prayed that believers should infallibly continue in faith. For they contradict Christ himself, who says: \"I have prayed for thee (Simon), that thy faith fail not,\" Luke 22:32; and the Evangelist John, who declares, that Christ has not prayed for the Apostles only, but also for those who through their word would believer: \"Holy Father, keep them in thy name,\" and: \"I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil one,\" John 17:11, 15, 20.*\n"
